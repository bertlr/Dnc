Dnc is a netbeans module to send and receive cnc programs to or from a cnc machine. 

It is in an very early development stage. Don't use for production.

First add a configuration for the serial port by clicking Tools->Options->Dnc
![Options dialog](OptionsDlg.png "screenshot of the options dialog")

Open a new File for the Program from a machine and select a configuration for the serial port in the toolbar drop down box.
